        <h1>This is a blog post!</h1>
        <p>I may get an internship, and I realised I should ask professors more questions (or at least make myself known to them)</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Why, you may ask?</h2>
        <p>Here are the following reasons, arranged in decreasing order of importance</p>
        <ol start = "1" type = "1">
            <li><p>Professors will remember you, which may help you get internships and recommendations.</p>
                <p>Some profs that seem like they will give opportunitites to students are:</p>
                <ul type = triangle>
                    <li>Prof Aaron Tan</li>
                    <li>Prof Tan Tiow Seng</li>
                    <li>Prof Jonathan Teo</li>
                    <li>Prof Adi Yoga</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li value = 1000>You get to clear your doubts when u ask them questions</li>
            <li>You may get to be a TA for the mods that they teach!</li>
        </ol>
